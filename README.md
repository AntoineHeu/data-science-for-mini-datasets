# data-science-for-mini-datasets
Applying data-science and ML concepts to small datasets is highly discutable but I would argue that even the small one can benefit from it - if the user keeps in mind that the results are to be taken with a grain of salt.
This repository aims to share with you some ML application I have been using as part of my job in the environmental industry. The code is oriented toward really small datasets: from 15 to 50 observations.

# Code
Edited on spyder via Anaconda.
Mostly based on the importation of csv files -> as DataFrame objects.
Because datasets are small a few check steps consist on having a direct observation of the data throughout the process.

# Disclaimer
This is a first approach on solving the problem of small dataset. Codes here are to ba taken as draft so do not hesitate to point out incoherency and improvements points
